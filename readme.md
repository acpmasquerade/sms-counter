SMS Counter
=============================
Character counter for SMS messages.
`Discontinued in favor of an independent repo for the PHP Class Library`

This repo was originally forked from [danxexe/sms-counter](http://github.com/danxexe/sms-counter) to provide a PHP port of the javascript library written by the original author.

However, the PHP class library is now maintained in a separate repo and is available for install via composer as well. [acpmasquerade/sms-counter-php](https://github.com/acpmasquerade/sms-counter-php)
